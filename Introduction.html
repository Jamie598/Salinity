    <h1> Introduction to the project</h1>
    <p><pre>I am doing my project on Ocean Salinity data analyzed monthly downloaded from the NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory. 
The title of my data is "NODC World Ocean Atlas 1998" and it will share salinity data around
the world in the year 1998 and will show which parts of the ocean had the highest salinity and the lowest salinity. </p>
